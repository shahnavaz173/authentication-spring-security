This is Simple Login application implemented using Spring Security Basic authentication with Bcrypt password hashing, Spring MVC, JSP &amp; JSTL. 

Currently it takes users from ArrayList i will add Database part later, and also the user Registration.

You can simply clone this project and import in eclipse no need to configure any other thing.
